# OrleansCouchBaseProviders

This repository aims to contain a set of providers for running [Microsoft Orleans](http://github.com/dotnet/orleans) using CouchBase as storage for everything. 

Currently a Storage Provider is included but Membership provider and reminders are being worked on and will be pushed here.

## Do you want to help?

Test it and report issues. We've tested this on CouchBase Community 4.1.
You can also write more Unit Tests if you will.
